# Options Pricing Visualizer

For this project, I want to be able to perform option pricing calculations for complex models like Black-Scholes, Binomial Trees and Monte Carlos simulation.

For the frontend, I intend to work with React and D3.js for visualization, atleast to make the charts interactive.

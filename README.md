# Options Pricing Visualizer

For this project, I want to be able to perform option pricing calculations for complex models like Black-Scholes, Binomial Trees and Monte Carlos simulation.

For the frontend, I intend to work with React and D3.js for visualization, atleast to make the charts interactive.

Well, I decided to install a few things in the frontend folder while at it:

```bash
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm install d3
npm install axios
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
